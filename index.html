		<p>According to all known laws of aviation,<br> there is no way a bee should be able to fly.<br> Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.<br> The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.<br> Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!<br> Let's shake it up a little.<br> Barry!<br> Breakfast is ready!<br> Coming!<br> Hang on a second. <br>Hello? - Barry? - Adam?<br> - Can you believe this is happening?<br> - I can't. I'll pick you up.<br> Looking sharp.<br> Use the stairs.<br> Your father paid good money for those.<br> Sorry. I'm excited.<br> Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.<br> A perfect report card, all B's.<br> Very proud.<br> Ma! I got a thing going here.<br> - You got lint on your fuzz. <br>- Ow! That's me! <br>- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.<br> - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!<br> - Hey, Adam.<br> - Hey, Barry. <br>- Is that fuzz gel? <br>- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different.<br> - Hi, Barry.<br> - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. <br>- Hear about Frankie? <br>- Yeah. <br>- You going to the funeral? <br>- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.<br> I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations.<br> Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. <br>- Well, Adam, today we are men. <br>- We are! <br>- Bee-men. <br>- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. <br>- Wonder what it'll be like? <br>- A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.<br> Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. <br>Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!<br> - That girl was hot. <br>- She's my cousin! <br>- She is? <br>- Yes, we're all cousins. <br>- Right. You're right. <br>- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. <br>- What do you think he makes? <br>- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? <br>- Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. <br>Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. <br>But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. <br>But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.<br> The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. <br>What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death?<br> We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?"<br> How can you say that? One job forever? <br>That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. <br>Now we only have to make one decision in life.<br> But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? <br>Why would you question anything?<br> We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.<br> You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?<br> Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.<br> Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out.<br> - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! <br>- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. <br>- Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! <br>- I wonder where they were. <br>- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.<br> You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. <br>You have to be bred for that. Right.<br> Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.<br> It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. <br>Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
